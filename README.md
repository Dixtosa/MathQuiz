<h1> Description </h1>
A very simple application written in Python. 
The user is asked to calculate a simple arithmetical expression in an adjustable duration (default is 60 seconds).

<h1> Whats new </h1>
<h2> 1.2 </h2>
This version is kept for only historical purposes only and beginners are not encouraged to read it for it might confuse them :)

<h2> 1.5 </h2>
Removed some of the premature stuff (e.g. splash, about and intro). Made the code a little more clever.

<h1> TO-DO </h1>
* Fix config and ranking
* Prolly make default duration standard (?)
